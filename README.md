## Overview
Minecraft Server Control GUI (mscGUI) is a new web-based interface to the [Minecraft Server Control Script](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs) that has been controlling many Linux and UNIX powered Minecraft servers since it was first released in 2011.


## Prerequisites for installation

The Minecraft Server Control GUI uses Perl to present a web-based interface to the [Minecraft Server Control Script](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs).  As such, the `mscs` script must be [installed](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/blob/master/README.md#installation) and working for the GUI to function.

Sine the GUI is web based, you will need to have a web server installed and working.  These directions assume you are using [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), but any web server solution should function.  To install Apache:

    sudo apt-get install apache2
