## Overview
Minecraft Server Control GUI (mscGUI) is a new web-based interface to the [Minecraft Server Control Script](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs) that has been controlling many Linux and UNIX powered Minecraft servers since it was first released in 2011.


## Prerequisites for installation

The Minecraft Server Control GUI uses Perl to present a web-based interface to the [Minecraft Server Control Script](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs).  As such, the `mscs` script must be [installed](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/blob/master/README.md#installation) and working for the GUI to function.

Since the GUI is web based, you will need to have a web server installed and working.  These directions assume you are using [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org), but any web server solution should function.  To install Apache:

    sudo apt-get install apache2



## Installation

### Download

If you followed the easiest way of [downloading the script](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/blob/master/README.md#downloading-the-script) when installing MSCS, then you will want to do the same here.  With `git` already installed:

    git clone https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscGUI.git


##### Other ways to download

This program is still in heavy development.  When I get around to having something stable I'll add
more options here.
